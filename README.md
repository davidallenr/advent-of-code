# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Each year's challenges are stored in a separate directory, and the status of each day's challenge is indicated in the file name (e.g. `year\day.py`).

## Usage

To run a solution, navigate to the directory for the corresponding year and run the Python script for the desired day. For example:

$ cd 2021
$ python day1_completed.py

Copy code

These solutions are provided for educational purposes only and may not be the most efficient or elegant solutions to the challenges. Use at your own risk.
